Module 2. Advanced React

Before we move to "advanced" React, it is important that we have a solid foundation of "basic" concepts of the framework (yes, I consider React [a framework](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/frontend/using-react-as-a-framework/), I don't care what the developers say). This module aims to brush up the fundamentals of React and touch upon some advanced concepts of React ecosystem. There are plenty of tools, techniques and libraries to learn and explore, so don't hesitate to venture out of this list to further your learning.
