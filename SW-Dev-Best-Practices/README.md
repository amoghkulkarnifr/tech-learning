Module 4. Software Development: Best practices

This module tries to cover essential concepts about how to structure your software *as well as* how to structure your software development processes. A software developer is often a part of a team, which makes it equally important for him/her be productive and to be a pleasant-to-work-with team member at the same time. 

Clean code principles and software patterns show promise to make you a productive developer ([even when you haven't touched your codebase for a few months](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2730:_Code_Lifespan)), whereas getting acquainted with DevOps and Agile concepts would make you a better team member.
